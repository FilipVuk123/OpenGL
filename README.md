# OpenGL
My first OpenGL project


Task:
    The idea is to show raw image (RGB, YUV or something similar) on screen using OpenGL. Once this works properly, you can optimize the process for your own graphics card. If no relevant optimizations are available, investigate your graphics card optimizations in general and compare its advantages to others.
